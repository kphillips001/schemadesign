## Add fruits table

Create a new migration to add the `fruits` table to the database. The schema for the table is:

- an `id` as the primary key, make it autoincrement.
- a `name` column that is a string, make it be unique and have a max lenght of 128 characters. It is required.
- a `avgWeightOz` column that stores **decimal** values.
- a `delicios` column that can store `true` or `false` values. Make it default to `true`.

Run the migration when done.
